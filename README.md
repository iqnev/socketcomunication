### About
It is a multithreaded client/server applications. The server  is  based on console app which uses Java Socket programming. On the other hand, the client is based on Qt with a real GUI.

A server listens for connection requests from clients across the network or even from the same machine. Clients know how to connect to the server via a host and port number. After connecting to the server, the client recives the certain message. After receiving the message from the server, the client shows the message.

------------

###  Design
The overall design of the program was split up into two components, one for the server and one for the client. These two components interact with each other using a socket. 

##### Server
The server is Java based console application.  Ð¢here is an implemented message generator on the server side. For each client that is connected to the server corresponds to a message queue. Thus, each message is stored in a separate queue. This ensures that each message will be sent to the relevant client.

The UML diagram in the figure below shows how the main components of the software interact.

UML Sequence Diagrams are interaction diagrams that detail how operations are carried out

##### Client
I mentioned above that the Client is based on Qt and there is a GUI.
